Hi this a student from the cse30 course. I recently found a vulnerability in the
gradebook program that this course uses. I was able to use gdb to find the password
to access my grade. Then because there's helper functions I could find
the point in memory thats compares a value of "2a" to another that one row below on
the stack to the password I input in memory. Then I could over flow the password
enough to put a value of 2a to match the and have admin access. I highly recommend
to fix this issue.
