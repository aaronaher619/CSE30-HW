One cpmmand that will be the saem is the flipping of the most significant bit
because once it is flipped it will only be neccesssary to flip it back which
requires the same command. A command that is different is the dividing by 2
which will require the new command to be multiply by 2 because these are 2 very
different thing and as such require 2 different commands.
