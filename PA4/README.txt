B. The error could have happened when you add a node to a tree. When
comparing the keys and deciding where to add. In both cases where the
key to add was bigger or smaller than the key being compared to the
programer could have only put to add to the left. A fix to this problem
would be to add the node to the right if bigger. The change would be
node->left to node->right in order to add to the right instead of left.

G. The error could be that when adding a node to the tree the programmer
accidentally made it so smaller nodes get added to the right and bigger
nodes are added to the left of the tree. A fix would be to reverse that
in order to add the node correctly in the tree.
